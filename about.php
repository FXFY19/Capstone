            This site is a place to upload your training card collection.
            <br>
            You can upload most TCG cards into the a database to be easily sorted, stored, and collect without going throught boxes or binders to find out if you have the card or not.
            In addition, you can upload any cards from any TGC!

            Currently, this site is programmed to take Cards from:
            <br>
            Cardfight Vanguard (CFV)
            <br>
            Magic the Gathering (MTG)
            <br>
            Pokemon TCG (PKM)
            <br>
            Yugioh (YGO)
        </p>

            Why did I created a Website to store Trading Cards?
            Answer: Because I have tried to sort and catalog my own trading card collection via boxes and binders and the system was tiresome and long. I have tried using 
            a system of Google Forms and Spreadsheets, but it was too time consuming. So, for my capstone, I created Card Binder, a website that I can just input the cards' traits
            into a form and able to sort and delete cards.
            Using a Card Polymorphism, all the cards traits are easily catagoized and easy to figure out which card is from what Game.
